AI-Generated Football History Reels — Project Submission
Live Demo Links
Frontend (Next.js UI): https://football-reels-frontend-nkv6qtcp0.vercel.app
Backend (API server on Vercel): https://backend-9siodtkjs-ujjwal-mishras-projects-8b666590.vercel.app
Project Overview
This project automatically generates football highlight reels using AI and presents them in a TikTok-style vertical video interface optimized for mobile. Each reel includes:
- A base image generated by OpenAI's DALL·E 3
- A short video clip generated using RunwayML Gen-3
- GPT-4-generated commentary
- Realistic voiceover generated via Amazon Polly
- Final video is stored in AWS S3 and metadata is stored in DynamoDB
Technologies Used
Frontend (Deployed on Vercel)
- Framework: Next.js (App Router)
- CSS: Tailwind CSS
- Components: TikTok-style scrollable video player (Reels.js)
- API Integration: Connected to deployed backend via full API URL
- Mobile-First Design: Scroll to play new videos, with clean CTA to trigger new reel generation
Backend (Deployed as Serverless APIs on Vercel)
- Express Server restructured as Vercel serverless functions
- Endpoints:
  - GET /api/videos: returns all generated videos from DynamoDB
  - POST /api/generate: triggers AI pipeline and uploads new video to S3
- Image Generation: OpenAI API (DALL·E 3)
- Video Generation: RunwayML SDK (Gen-3 Alpha)
- Text-to-Speech: AWS Polly (Matthew voice)
- Storage: AWS S3 for video, DynamoDB for metadata
How It Works
1. User triggers "Generate" from frontend (button).
2. Backend starts AI pipeline:
   - Generate image from OpenAI
   - Convert image to short video via Runway
   - Generate commentary using GPT-4
   - Convert to audio with Amazon Polly
   - Merge video & audio via ffmpeg
   - Upload final MP4 to S3
   - Save metadata to DynamoDB
3. Frontend fetches reels from GET /api/videos and plays them in full-screen vertical scroll.
Testing & Deployment
- Frontend and backend were deployed separately on Vercel
- Fully working end-to-end deployment with no local dependencies
- Used .env.local and Vercel Environment Variables to securely configure AWS/OpenAI credentials
Summary
This project showcases AI automation for creative storytelling with real-time API integration and seamless deployment. Built from scratch, it demonstrates:
- Clean UI/UX using Next.js + Tailwind
- Smooth integration of multiple AI services
- Serverless deployment with full S3/DynamoDB backend
- Real-time dynamic video generation with secure API design

Summary of Key Issues and Resolutions
1. Tailwind CSS Setup Issues
•	• Initial setup repeatedly failed due to 'npx tailwindcss init -p' not working properly.
•	• Resolution: Recreated the Next.js app using create-next-app with Tailwind CSS option selected. Confirmed Tailwind works out of the box in this mode and avoided unnecessary manual setup.
2. GitHub Submodule Issue (Frontend)
•	• Frontend was initialized as a Git submodule, preventing it from showing in GitHub and Vercel.
•	• Resolution: Removed the .git directory inside frontend, ran 'git rm --cached frontend', then added frontend again using 'git add frontend'.
3. Backend Deployment and 401/404 Errors
•	• Even after successful deployment, backend API was throwing 401 or 404 errors.
•	• Cause: Missing environment variables in deployed backend or authorization issues from Vercel's side.
•	• Resolution: Ensured .env variables are present and correct in Vercel’s backend project settings, then redeployed.
4. Environment Variable Not Working in Frontend
•	• Frontend failed to use deployed backend URL and threw 404 or 401 errors.
•	• Resolution: Added environment variables to Vercel’s frontend project settings and redeployed after ensuring code used `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`.
5. RunwayML Content Generation Pipeline
•	• RunwayML video generation worked, but merging with audio using FFmpeg failed initially.
•	• Resolution: Installed FFmpeg locally, verified path setup, and wrapped merging code with try-catch block.
6. Final Frontend Deployment Stuck to Wrong Path
•	• Repeated deployment attempts failed due to incorrect root path being set as 'frontend/frontend'.
•	• Resolution: Removed `.vercel` folder from frontend, re-ran `vercel` CLI with correct settings and new unique project name.
7. Misleading Authentication Redirect (Vercel 401 Error)
•	• Got 401 error that looked like backend auth issue but was due to Vercel project scope mismatch.
•	• Resolution: Logged out from Vercel CLI, re-logged in, selected correct personal scope (not project team), and re-deployed frontend.
